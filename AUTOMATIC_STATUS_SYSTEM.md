# 🤖 Automatic Status Management System

## ✅ System Successfully Implemented!

The KMRL Train Induction System now has **automatic status management** that ensures trains are always in the correct operational state based on maintenance schedules and fitness certificates.

## 🎯 How It Works

### Automatic Status Changes:

1. **🔴 FITNESS EXPIRY CHECK**
   - When: Fitness certificate expires
   - Action: Status → `OUT_OF_ORDER`
   - Purpose: Safety compliance - expired trains cannot operate

2. **🔧 MAINTENANCE DUE CHECK**
   - When: Next maintenance date is reached
   - Action: Status → `MAINTENANCE`
   - Purpose: Enforce scheduled maintenance

3. **✅ RETURN TO SERVICE**
   - When: Maintenance completed (last maintenance date updated)
   - Action: Status → `AVAILABLE`
   - Purpose: Automatically return trains to service pool

4. **🧹 DAILY CLEANING SCHEDULE**
   - When: 10:00 PM daily
   - Action: 30% of available trains → `CLEANING`
   - Return: Midnight (12:00 AM) → `AVAILABLE`
   - Purpose: Regular cleaning rotation

## ⏰ Schedule

The system runs automatically:
- **Every Hour**: Full status check for all trainsets
- **10:00 PM Daily**: Cleaning schedule activation
- **12:00 AM Daily**: Return from cleaning

## 📊 Real Example from Your System

## 🚨 Alert System

The system provides warnings:
- **7 days before** maintenance is due

- **Daily summary** of status changes

## 📝 Audit Trail

Every automatic status change is logged with:
- Trainset number
- Old status → New status
- Reason for change
- Exact timestamp
- Can be exported for compliance reports

## 💡 Smart Features

### Prevents Conflicts:
- Won't schedule cleaning for trains in maintenance
- Won't mark OUT_OF_ORDER trains for maintenance
- Respects manual overrides

### Intelligent Scheduling:
- Rotates cleaning among available trains
- Considers operational hours
- Balances workload

## 🔧 Configuration

Current settings:
```javascript
{
  statusCheckInterval: "Every hour",
  cleaningTime: "10:00 PM",
