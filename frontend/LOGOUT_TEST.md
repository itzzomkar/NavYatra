# 🚀 KMRL Train Induction System - Logout Fix Verification

## 📋 **Logout Issue Resolution**

The application was experiencing a bug where after signing out, it would get stuck in a loading state instead of redirecting to the login page. This has been fixed with the following improvements:

### 🔧 **Fixes Applied:**

#### 1. **Enhanced ProtectedRoute Component**
- Added better token checking logic
- Immediate redirect when no authentication tokens are present
- Smarter loading state management to prevent infinite loading

#### 2. **Improved useAuth Hook**
- Enhanced logout function with proper state clearing
- Ensures `isLoading` is set to `false` immediately after logout
- Better error handling for logout operations

#### 3. **Upgraded Header Component Logout**
- Added force cleanup of localStorage data
- Implemented `window.location.href` for complete page refresh
- Fallback cleanup even if API logout fails

### ✅ **Testing Instructions:**

1. **Login to the application:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/login` (or the port shown in your terminal)
